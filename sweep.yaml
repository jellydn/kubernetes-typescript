# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create an pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - "All docstrings and comments should be up to date."
  - "Code should follow consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes."
  - "Avoid using magic numbers in the code. Instead, use named constants for better readability and maintainability."
  - "Ensure that code is properly formatted and indented according to the project's style guide."
  - "Remove any unused or redundant code to keep the codebase clean and maintainable."
  - "Use descriptive and meaningful comments to explain complex or non-obvious parts of the code."

# This is the branch that Sweep will develop from and make pull requests to. Most people use 'main' or 'master' but some users also use 'dev' or 'staging'.
branch: 'main'

# By default Sweep will read the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions. To disable this, set this to false.
gha_enabled: True

# This is the description of your project. It will be used by sweep when creating PRs. You can tell Sweep what's unique about your project, what frameworks you use, or anything else you want.
#
# Example:
#
# description: sweepai/sweep is a python project. The main api endpoints are in sweepai/api.py. Write code that adheres to PEP8.
description: ''

# This sets whether to create pull requests as drafts. If this is set to True, then all pull requests will be created as drafts and GitHub Actions will not be triggered.
draft: False

# This is a list of directories that Sweep will not be able to edit.
blocked_dirs: []

# The 'description' setting is used to provide a brief overview of your project. This information is used by Sweep when creating pull requests. It can include details about the project's unique features, the frameworks used, coding standards, etc.
# The 'draft' setting determines whether pull requests should be created as drafts. If set to true, all pull requests will be created as drafts and GitHub Actions will not be triggered.
# The 'blocked_dirs' setting is a list of directories that Sweep is not allowed to edit. This can be used to prevent Sweep from making changes to certain parts of your codebase.

# This is a list of documentation links that Sweep will use to help it understand your code. You can add links to documentation for any packages you use here.
#
# Example:
#
# docs:
#   - PyGitHub: ["https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/", "We use pygithub to interact with the GitHub API"]
docs: []

# Sandbox executes commands in a sandboxed environment to validate code changes after every edit to guarantee pristine code. For more details, see the [Sandbox](./sandbox) page.
sandbox:
  install:
    - trunk init
  check:
    - trunk fmt {file_path} || return 0
    - trunk check --fix --print-failures {file_path}
# The 'docs' setting is a list of documentation links that Sweep can use to better understand your code. This can include links to documentation for any packages or libraries used in your project.
# The 'sandbox' section specifies commands that are executed in a sandboxed environment to validate code changes. This helps ensure that all code changes are valid and do not introduce any new issues.
